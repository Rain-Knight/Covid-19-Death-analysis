# Covid-19-Death-analysis

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on global health and the economy.

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the relationships of certain variables surrounding the beginning (Febrary, 2020 - April, 2021) of the Covid-19 pandemic in New Zealand and worldwide.

This is done by using publicly available datasets from Our World in Data.

This project places specific emphasis on understanding the local and international early and peak death toll and case contraction alongside vaccination rates and stringecy index, and how these fit into the bigger picture of the international pandemic.
